<div class="two-col">
The Master’s Degree in Advanced Infographics is a postgraduate professional program at the convergence of technology, architecture, art and design presented by Universidad Politécnica de Madrid.

Its academic structure offers advanced training in the technical skills necessary to recast the boundaries of these disciplines, while fostering critical thought in the context of design speculation.

The course is intended for qualified architects, engineers, artists or designers who have completed their bachelor´s degree or equal level certificate. The program consists of 300 hours (30 ECTS) from January 2020 to June 2020, Monday through Thursday, every afternoon (15.45 to 21.00). During this time, it is recommended a full-time dedication in order to develope and complete practical work

## 1. PROJECT GENERATION I 10ECTS
<div class="two-col">
Digital Fundamentals. Basic concepts and terminology to conceive infography as a fiel of knowledge and production based on algorithms, geometries, structures, shapes and images within the current context and the prospective evolution of digital tools regarding to project designing.

Advanced Workflows. Multiplatform operational workflows for the creation, realization and presentation of achitecture and urbanism projects.

Digital Morphologies. Form generation, nature and properties based on the personalized selection of variables in its design.

Digital Systems. Geometric automation based on the assembly, sets and aggregation of related components conforming complex entities.

Advanced Parameterization of Prototypes. Visual programming of reactive and adaptive parametric projects.

Disciplinary Simulations. Generation of subsystems integrating the project based on disciplines (structural, bioclimatic, constructive, physical, infrastructural). The result is the elaboration of FEM calculation documents and structural dimensioning, and decision making regarding thermodynamic bioclimatic strategies.

Multidisciplinary Design Systems. Dynamic models programming as a support to transversely cross routines of different disciplines.

<div class="two-col">
History and Technique of the Image. Contextual evolution of the pictorial representation related to the production techniques.

Diagramming and Graphic Representation. Production of graphic presentation of a proposition, of the project´s scheme, of the relations between the different parts or elements of a set or system.

Image Production. Conception and pictorial materialization of ideas, narratives, atmospheres through rendering managing for its postproduction.

Hyperrealism. Production of scenes and scenarios with maximum fidelity to reality.

Digital Landscape. Generation of three-dimensional natural environments conformed as complex ecosystems.

Three-dimensional abstraction. Three-dimensional and two-dimensional reduction of realities to their minima expression.

## 3. NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR INFOGRAPHICS I 10 ECTS
<div class="two-col">
3D animation and motion design. Elaboration of the narrative of the project.

Algorithms, Data and Processes. Programming languages and computational logic to develop interactive procedures and simulations based on data visualization.

Virtual Reality. Inmersion in real-time three-dimensional environments integrated with the user through modal devices or interfaces and the exploration of the associated interactive resources.

Composition and Edition. Simulation of animation effects and moving graphics.

Cinematic Animation, VFX. Transfer of advanced film techniques in architectural graphic expression.

Integrated Postproduction. Final treatment of crossing channels and formats to obtain static or dynamic images representative or the project.

Impossible Images. Extreme exploration of images transcending the limits of reality enhancing creativity and expressiveness.

Final Documents. Compilation and final management or the course products with hierarchical criteria.

Digital Project Laboratories. Workshops integrating all the knowledge and skills on the project, supervised by experts invited in each subject, which will generate constructive debate and exchage of ideas.
