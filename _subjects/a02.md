## DGM Digital Morphologies
Number of Sessions/Duration 9 (22.5 hours)

### Seminar’s description:
Generation, nature and properties of form based on chosen custom design inputs. We introduce students
to relational ways of generating and analyzing architecture using visual programming. A project based
learning method will allow to elaborate a useful catalog of morphogenerative protocols and tools that
can be used on project making situations. The student will acquire as well a critical capacity about digital
and parametrical tools. During this seminar, dicussions about some of the current architectural fashions
related to these tools will be held. The main branches of computational geometry are:
Combinatorial computational geometry, also called algorithmic geometry, which deals with geometric objects as discrete entities
Numerical computational geometry, also called machine geometry, computer-aided geometric design (CAGD), or geometric modeling, which deals primarily with representing real-world objects in forms suitable for computer computations in CAD/CAM systems.

### Milestone:
Computational Forms Catalogue: A Design Space. An adaptative procedural environment open to student’s speculative proposals
