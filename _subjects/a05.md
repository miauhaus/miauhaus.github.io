## a.05 Advanced Parametrization of Prototypes
Number of Sessions/Duration 12 (30 hours)

### Seminar’s description:
Responsive architectural parametric prototypes through visual programming. This seminar will seek to combine the visual programming’s concepts and protocols to full reactive and adaptative prototypes and its context. This seminar opens the possiblity to the interpretation and exchange of the generated geometry and its attributes to BIM formats and models.
BIM Megabuildings: Low Carbon Buildings, Climate-Context-Culture, Comfort and Energy, Sustainable Service Systems for Mega-Buildings, Multidisciplinar Design Systems (MDS), Megaconstructions, Planning and Phases.

### Professors:
Sergio del Castillo, Pablo Gómez Rodríguez, Miauhaus Team

### Milestone:
Megabuilding Project Documnentation and Programming.
