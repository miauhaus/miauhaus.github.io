## a.06 Multidisciplinary Design Systems
Number of Sessions/Duration 12 (30 hours)

### Seminar’s description:
Dynamic and interrelated model programming as a 3D framewrok to cross different disciplines routines. Conceived as a disciplinary environments solutions (such as the structural, bioclimatic or infrastructure subsystem) integrated into a whole analysis system, the aim is to understand the project as an interrelated subsystem assembly. In the same way, the aim is to learn the basics of evolutionary design applied to a project and thus, combined with other’s subject content, turning digital tools into useful prospective tools for projecting.
Multi-objective optimization (also known as multi-objective programming, vector optimization, multicriteria optimization, multiattribute optimization or Pareto optimization) is an area of multiple criteria decision making that is concerned with mathematical optimization problems involving more than one objective function to be optimized simultaneously.
