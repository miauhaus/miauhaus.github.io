title: Disciplinary Simulations
course: miau
code: A04
description: Generation of subsystems integrating the project based on disciplines (structural, bioclimatic, infrastructural...) in such a way as to produce simulations of the prototypes modeled, as well as their programmatic and geometric optimization for such objectives. The result is the elaboration of calculation documents and decision making regarding thermodynamic bioclimatic strategies

## a.04 Disciplinary Simulations
Number of Sessions/Duration 12 (30 hours)

### Seminar’s description:
Tools for the creation of virtual scenarios simulating restricted live physical conditions. The aim is to acquire the ability to model complex livealike systems such as tensile structures, inflatables, minimal surfaces, unfoldable surfaces, depoyable structures and analyse its behaviour as a force and vector input’s result through time. Particle Systems and FEM Finite Element Modeling for physical calculations. Proper remeshing for each case of study.
