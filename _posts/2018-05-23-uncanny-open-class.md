“We can only touch the Real with the support of fantasy” Lacan.

Last semester we celebrated ETSAM open doors with an UNCANNY DYNAMICS' open class where students scanned themselves with kinect in order to have all the textures and elements to develop a 3D print of their faces. Students joined us and saw how a scan is made in kinect and what theories are applied in developing the uncanny in projects.

This Open Class took place at the Digital Fabrication LAB (FABLAB) at Madrid Architecture School (ETSAM). The class UNCANNY DYNAMICS was given by Ruxandra Iancu Bratosin. Uncanny Dynamics focuses on researching the boundaries between material and digital and the flow between one world to another. The class explores the possibilities of experiencing everyday objects in an unsettling, alienating or taboo context, based on Freud’s definition of “uncanny” and Lacan’s theory on experiencing “the Real”.
