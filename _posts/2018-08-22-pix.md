MIAU team members were selected to take part in PIX Generative Hackathon at Guiyang, Guizhou, China: Five days of radical design, collaboration, creativity and joy. PIX Generative Hackathon aims to reimagine how cars are made and explore new automobile manufacturing paradigm with creative digital design approaches and new digital manufacturing processes, further driving innovation in the automobile industry and lighting a beacon for next-generation manufacturing. Adaptive skins, changeable grids, topostructures, optimization and social points of view, Mechanical Design Engineers, Industrial Designers, Parametric Designers, Architects, Interdisciplinary Designers, etc.

The Proposal: The Pixel Drop
The idea is based in the creation of an adaptive vehicle capable of modifying its form to fit with new uses for the city and for its users: the vehicle becomes a membrane of exchange between the public and the private. The concept is generated by two unitary pieces: a rigid one (chassis) calculated by topostructuralization from which expandable supports emerge to pull the second piece that is a versatile skin, a malleable grid made out of an auxetic metal tissue.
The chassis was designed to reach the optimal distribution of the material based on support at most curv weigth of 450kg with a predetermined volume and support conditions. Designed to be 3D-printed in carbon fiber, the chassis structure is assembled with aluminum nodes to the wheels control arms, and it complies with the main proposal goal of controling frame´s auto parts less than 10 making manufacturing processes more efficient.

The Concept Design of the Pixel Drop takes into account four principles: a) help people enjoy the time moving, b) help the city better take care of itself and society, c) enhance a better utilization of the ground (better parking solutions related to a variety of new uses) and c) make moving objects feasible in different scenarios according to certain urban situations: a moving tent for enhance intimacy moments, a glass ball for sightseeing, a tree-like space for slow down city life, a sprinkler machine car for cleaning and increasing evapotranspiration, a public restroom for public mass events, a self-stretching lantern car for a better parking and easy storage solutions, and a flexible moving screen for summer projections.
Proyect developed by Francesc Sòria Castellet, Leticia Izquierdo Garcia, Sergio Del Castillo Tello, Yueyi Chen, Antonia Yeung and Chuyao Zhou.
