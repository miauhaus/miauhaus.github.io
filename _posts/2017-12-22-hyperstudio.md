‘Interactive Hypermedia: Designing communication strategies in digital environments for the future’ was a 6-day workshop taught within our Web Lab. From a few simple interfaces developed in p5 and 3js, each student developed an interactive platform related to each of their research topics for the final projects.

The results of the workshop were presented in a ByOB at the ‘MIAU’s Closing the Night’ event within the ETSAM open house week.
