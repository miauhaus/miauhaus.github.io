# VR OPEN CLASS - Reactive Environments&Landscapes final projects
REACTIVE ENVIRONMENTS & LANDSCAPES came to an end last May. We watched the projects that the students developed during the course and we experimented with them. Every project was shown with VR glasses.
This class is part of REACTIVE ENVIRONMENT & LANDSCAPES, given by Daniel Bas.

Here are two projects developed by two of our students: Sergio Limiñana and Francesc Sòria.
