## P0.00 Definition
This research aims to explore new potential project mechanisms based on radical thermodynamic postulates, developing a protocol of relationship between the form without attributes and its atmosphere, in other words, the climatic conditions that are generated inside. 

## P0.01 Introduction
It is an exploration where form and function appear derived from thermodynamic variables used in our research, where environmental factors are able to model an architecture much more committed to the environment.

### P1.00 Context
This research is based on the criticism of the traditional architectural process, away from energy premises, trusting technology to be able to replace the deficiencies caused by an excess of confidence in the design in later stages of the project

### P2.00 Objectives
P2.01 Generate a shapegrammar algorithm based on climatic conditions that is able to parametrize a set of morphological rules operative for the design process of an architectural project.
P2.02 Carry on a study on this shapegrammar routine with the same rules applied to 4 different world climates and test the morphological differences and similarities between these architectures and study how every example performs based several measurable climatic parameters such as comfort or inner conditions.

### P3.00 Methodology
We will develop an alternative methodology that, while maintaining the interests of sustainability, can set up its principles on a modeling and design tool and not as an element added afterwards. The experiments that we will carry out will be based on a shapegrammar, a system of rules that will be executed recursively, reproducing the generative process time and again looking for the optimization of a variable under study (e.g. comfort). 

### P4.00 Production 
Programmed Dynamic Prototype based on Visual Programming Platform (Ladybug and HoneyBee tools, Grasshopper3D node-based software, McneelTM)

### P5.00 Results, Conclusions and Future Research 
The development of this research has started a lab test able to expand the design process in an architectural project. 
The difficulty of such a job implies such a complexity that we see ourselves forced to simplify the process and tools carried out. 
Nevertheless, in these first simulated experiments the results shows how clearly the specific weather of every region shape the architectural form (and the architectural form the indoors condition of space) and it can be measured and analyzed in real time, thus eliminating the gap between design and analysis, proposing strategies and testing its viability.
This experiments shows as well how easy is to parametrize a set of rules and change the conventional design process of shaping the result instead of designing the process of shapes based on parameters.
We know for sure architecture are not boxes nor simple volumes, but yhis reasearch is meant only to be the beginning of a deeper work involving both theorical and practical tests further on in the upcoming years.
