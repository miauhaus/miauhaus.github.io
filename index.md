# About Miauhaus
{:.section #about}
<div class="two-col">
miauhaus is an open research community

our mission is to enjoy sharing and creating knowledge

digital processes are project’s tools. They are as important as the project itself: they go alongside with it, they make it possible, they generate it, reinforce it, explain it, communicate it, they allow it to be collaborative, they connect it to its context, revealing links that are not visible at first sight. Digital processes are the support of the team’s intuition, they are the way in which decisions are taken in scientific research, and the communication media in the final decisions taken. In addition, they build the ethic and aesthetic of the message we want to express, defend and proclaim. Infographic is not just image. Infographic is algorithm, geometry, structure, shape, and, in the end, an image (W. Mirregan) inside the constructive process of a project

miauhaus is a critical and productive environment. The best infographics are clear, straightforward and attractive. A growing demand of images has generated a high amount of designers. They connect with people that are not usually interested in buildings but in life, people and the atmosphere that these visualizations are able to transmit. Renders are to architecture what trailers are to films. After more than 10 years of experience in the Infographics Course Specialization, we don’t want just to train great and efficient architectonic image professionals, we want to optimize their workflows and make them know the tools that in the near future will be part of the architectonic image communication as much as today static images’ render are. The program is based on the real practice of architecture studios and will employ every tool to give not only the best result but to optimize time and work, in addition to offer new possibilities in generating and communicating architectural projects

miauhaus is a creative and generative environment. About infographics as an algorithm, about support in creation, is indispensable to understand that mastering the tools to produce other tools that will end up shaping the project is the most interesting goal of every design process, avoiding preset and prefabricated solutions that come from the lack of tools’ control: customization by specialization

miauhaus qualify us to combine diverse visions in collaborative multi platform environments, giving value to the interconnection that must be at the process’ service. This process is building itself, is dynamic, always open, able to dialogue with the most basic analogue methods and also sustained in state-of-the-art tech
